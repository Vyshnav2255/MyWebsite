## Introduction
Have you ever experienced this where you have to do a task, but don't have the mood to do it. Ya, I know you do, and even I have faced this issue. Sometimes I will plan to write a blog post, but I will not be in mind to write it. This article will help you to solve that issue. This article is an outcome of this.

## The Rule
The method I am going to share is called the 5 Minute Rule. If you start practicing this, it will surely help you overcome procrastination. I am writing this article after practicing this for sometimes, and it has really helped to stop procrastination. **The rule says that when you want to do a task but don't have the mood to do it, just focus on the task for 5 minutes, and you will be involved in the task after that**. Human beings face this issue called starting trouble just like cars do, where we don't like to do a task, but when you start doing it for 5 minutes, you will get involved in that work and do it for an extended period. Don't use a timer for setting the 5 minutes, then the notification will surely end your ability to work, and instead of focusing on the work, you will be checking for the amount of time left. Apply this rule only after keeping all your distractions aside. This rule is based on Newton's first law. (which applies to productivity also).
> An object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.

## Alternative
If you don't have the patients to sit for 5 minutes, just do it for 2 or 3 minutes. Just practice doing this daily. The is to just get started, remember the newton law **Object in motion stays in motion**. And even this doesn't work, schedule the task for some other day.

## Final Thoughts
You can apply this rule to many places where you feel that you are procrastinating. You can even use this rule while doing workouts. Just practice this for one week and share your thoughts on the comment section or message me on social media.
