##### **Todoist**
It's the best todo application that I have ever used. I have tried many todo applications but I always end up using todoist. Adding tasks is very easy because of its natural language processing. And the UI of the app is awesome, also it has multi-platform support.

##### **Notion**
No one word can describe this app. It's one of the best productivity application which I have ever used. it is an all in one solution for all the productivity freaks. it can be used in many ways, like a todo application, note-taking application, bullet journal and many more. you can access all the templates from their official website. it is a web-based application and has multi-platform support.

##### **Habitify**
The best habit tracking application for android users. It has the best UI compared to other habit tracking applications. it's the only habit tracking application with multi-platform support.

##### **Google Keep**
Best note-taking app with a minimalistic UI from Google.

##### **5217**
It's a great app for getting things done. Also, you can buy a premium for changing the time.
