#### **Introduction**

Google keep is one of the best notes taking app I have ever used. It is excellent for creating quick notes. It also has a todo and voice note feature. Here, I am going to show you a simple trick to take notes even faster to capture your ideas quickly.

#### **Process**

Press and hold Google Keep icon to open app shortcuts. There you find an option **"New text note."** Press and hold that and drag the icon to your home screen. Now click on that it opens a new note page in Google Keep.

#### **Bonus(Android users)**

If you don't like the icon, you can press and hold the shortcut and click on customize ( which is available in most launchers) and choose the icon which you prefer.
