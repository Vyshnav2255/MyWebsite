As Google has recently released its first developer preview of its latest Android OS, they showcased the new easter egg of the new Android version. So I created some wallpaper inspired by that easter egg. And I hope many of you will like these wallpapers.

This pack contains 7 wallpapers.

### **Resolution**
These wallpaper are made in 4K resolution. I have tested these wallpapers on many devices and had no issues, they work perfectly. And if any of you have any issues please comment below or DM me on any of my social media accounts.
