The problem with young designers is that they become more dedicated to work and start spending more time on it, since they don't have a family to take care of. They start developing all sorts of unhealthy habits, such as waking up and going to bed late, eating unhealthy foods, not exercising or engaging in physical activity, drinking a lot of caffeine and sugary drinks, and not getting enough sleep.

Yes, being really creative, creating a lot of cool things, and working hard are important. However, when you look at this routine in the long term, you start to experience burnout. Your body is affected both physically and mentally.

I have seen this happen to many designers. Their initial fire goes out after a while.

So, my suggestion is to take it slowly. Don’t torture your body to become creative, as this will lead to burnout fast. Instead, start developing some healthy habits:

- Eat healthy foods.
- Lift weights.
- Go for a walk or run.
- Maintain a regular sleep schedule.
- Sleep for at least 7 hours every day.
- Do some stretching exercises after sitting for 50 minutes.
- Avoid sugar.
- Stay hydrated.
- Meditate for 10 minutes every day.

I know you are tempted to create stuff after seeing cool items created by other designers. I’m not telling you to not do it; instead, I’m suggesting that you give more priority to your health. Your body will thank you later.
