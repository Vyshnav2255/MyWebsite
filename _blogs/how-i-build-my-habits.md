You might have heard about habit tracking, but habit building is different. Here you only track a single habit for an entire month. You can also add a reward for successfully building a habit. And this is a simple template for tracking it.

A new year is coming, and you might have already planned to build many good habits. But the issue is a lot of people work on multiple habits at once. At first, this is easy because you have a lot of enthusiasm in the first week of starting a habit. But later, this becomes hard, and people give up.

As author Derek Sivers said in his book How to Live
>Falling in love is easy. Staying in love is harder. Enthusiasm is common. Endurance is rare.


Building a single habit is a lot better than multiple habits. This is the same concept Netflix filmmaker, YouTuber & entrepreneur [Matt D'Avella](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXKuahfdkl6zkBULJhEMNy_RnErOYXwJk) uses. I have been using this concept to build my habits, and I successfully did it. So I thought of sharing this Notion template and PDF with you.

Remember, take it slowly. And never miss two days in a row. And don't feel bad about yourself if you skipped a few days, it's okay.

The template and PDF are FREE. You can get it from my Buy Me a Coffee page or click the below links to get your copy.
