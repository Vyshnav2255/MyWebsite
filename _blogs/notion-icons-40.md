![Notion Icons 4.0](/Images/Blog/15.png "Notion Icons 4.0")

This is a modified version of my [Notion Icons 2.0 pack](/blog/notion-icons-2-0).

This pack is a minimal version of that pack. As always, it supports both light and dark modes.
Currently the **pack contains 272 icons**.

All icons are available in 8 different colors.
You can download it from here.
