### Introduction
I'm back with another cool icon pack for you Notion users out there. Many people might be confused with my old icon packs naming, so to avoid that confusion, I have named this pack **Notion Prism Icons**.

### Specifications
It took me a lot of time to make these icons, and I think it was worth the time. I have been using and tweaking this icon pack for the past few weeks. These are minimal icons. All icons are available in **20 different colors**.

**Size** - 500x500

**Format** - PNG

It works perfectly in both light and dark mode. Here is a sneak peek at how it looks.

And much more...

I liked this pack the most compared to my other icon packs. This pack consists of
![1220 Icons](/Images/Blog/18-3.png)

All my previous packs only contained less than 300 icons. So navigating between these 1220 icons might be difficult.

Don't worry, I got you. To make it easier for you to pick the icons, I have sorted all icons based on the color, and you just have to open the folder of your favorite color and choose the right icon for your setup.

### Conclusion
This pack is my biggest release, and I think you guys will really enjoy it. Thank you everyone, for your massive support for my earlier icon packs. Also, Thank you so much for all my Buy me a Coffee supporters. Your support has helped me a lot in this journey. You guys are fantastic.
