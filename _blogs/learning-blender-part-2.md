As mentioned in [my last post](/blog/i-started-learning-blender), I spent this week learning Blender. This time my priority was to create small projects. The tutorial I followed was from [Polygon Runway](https://www.youtube.com/c/PolygonRunway). They make some great tutorials for intermediate.

Also, as promised, here is the blender file for [my Donut project](https://shop.vyshnav.xyz/l/sztgx). It’s available for free, download it, play with it, learn from it & keep it as a reference file if you encounter any issues while creating your Donut.

Some updates on my Santa hat - I played with the BG, camera, & lighting for some time and finally ended up with this.

If you want to play with it, I have published the Blender file on my Gumroad. You can [get it for free](https://shop.vyshnav.xyz/l/lwzud).

My 3rd project was to create a Pokeball. I made a few mistakes while working on this project. The cut in the middle part of the outer sphere was done using the *Knife tool*. And I messed up while doing it. Later, when I applied *modifiers* to the shape, I saw some weird artifacts in it.

At first, I thought it was only visible in the *Solid mode*, but later, when I rendered the final model, the artifacts were clearly visible. So I switched to *Wireframe mode* and found a few extra *Edges* made during the *Knife cut*.

I manually removed those *Edges* from the shape. This fixed the weird artifacts problem. The final render came out really great.

I loved this Pokeball render so much that I made a few light adjustments and rendered it as a wallpaper. Here is how it looks on my PC.

After the Pokeball project, I started my 4th project, to model a plant. I learned some cool new tricks while working on this. Here is how the final render came out.

It looks great, but I’m not happy with it. I will be playing with the BG, leaves, and lighting to see if it improves the look.

I will be sharing the Blender files of both projects next week. I hope you enjoyed this blog post.
