I have made a lot of icon packs for Notion, but the number of covers I made was less, so I thought of creating some covers related to months.

{% include elements/image.html url="/Images/Blog/22-1.png" name="Notion Month Covers - Light Mode" %}
{% include elements/image.html url="/Images/Blog/22-2.png" name="Notion Month Covers - Dark Mode" %}

This pack contains **108 covers** in total. All covers are available in **9 color variants**. The cover works well on both desktops and smartphones. These covers use the same colors which Notion uses in their workspace. It looks gorgeous in both light and dark modes.
