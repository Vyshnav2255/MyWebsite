First of all, thank you so much for your massive support for my [Notion Prism Icons](/blog/notion-prism-icons). Thanks to all the people who have purchased it and shared their wonderful feedbacks with me.

This time I'm coming with another cool icon pack for Notion. You might be wondering now why this guy is releasing a lot of icon packs. The reason is I want my icon packs to be in every price range. This is why I release different icon packs with different colors and types.

Prism icon pack is my premium product, and I know it is a bit pricey, so I thought of creating a much affordable icon pack, and that's how this pack was created.

These icons are unique because they feature the same colors that Notion uses in their workspace. All icons are available in **9 different colors**. It also features the same icons from my Prism Icon pack. The pack contains a total of **549 icons**.

I have been using these icons for the past month, and I'm really enjoying them. Being able to match the icon color with the font is great.
