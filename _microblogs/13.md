For those who have trouble falling asleep😴, reading📗 is one of the best ways to fall asleep. It will make your eyes👁️ tired, and you will feel relaxed😌. You will also get higher quality sleep💤 while doing this.

If you are not in a mood to read, you can listen👂🏻 to a podcast🎙️ by reducing the playback speed and setting a sleep timer⏲️. Keep the playback speed to 0.7 or less.
