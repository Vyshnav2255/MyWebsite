Rather than set a big🏋️ sweeping goal, think of the smallest action you could take each day🗓️ to accomplish what you ultimately want. And I do mean small: your micro-goal🎯 should take under 10 minutes to complete✅. 5 minutes is even better. Then do it every day🗓️. That’s it🎉. This is the strategy behind setting micro-goals🎯.
