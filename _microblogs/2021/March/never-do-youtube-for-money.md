I have seen many people starting YouTube channels📺 just for earning money💵. This is the reason why most people fail to become a Youtuber. All successful✨ Youtuber have started youtube long back without thinking about money, and all they wanted was to share their knowledge or skills with the world. This is the reason why they became successful. My advice is, do it only if you have an interest in a subject or skill that you want to share with the world. Do it thinking that you will not get any money.

> Set up your business like you don’t need the money, and it’ll likely come your way.
