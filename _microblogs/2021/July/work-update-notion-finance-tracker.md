Got some free time today, so I worked on the v2 of my [Notion Finance Tracker](/blog/notion-finance-tracker). More awesome features have been added and also it is now more easier to use.

It will take some time to release. Because I need to make sure it is easy to use and test all the new features for sometime. Currently it is going well.

If you're using my Notion Finance Tracker v1, please share your feedback, so that I can make improvements in the new version. You can message me on Twitter or mail me.
