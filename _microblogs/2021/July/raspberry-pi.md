Just found this [Raspberry Pi subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/) and saw a lot of people making cool stuffs with it. I really love this credit card sized computer, even though I don't own one. But after seeing a lot of cool project, I'm definitely going to buy one.

If anyone reading this post own a Raspberry Pi, please DM or Mail me how you use it in your daily life.
