I was testing the Twitter beta app for a while and day before yesterday I opted out. But I was still receiving the beta updates. So I reinstalled the Twitter app yesterday morning. And I was unable to login. There was some issue with receiving the verification code. So I sent a mail to Twitter regarding this and they didn't solve it till now.

Thanks to them I got a break from Twitter for a full day. So I got time to focus on other things. The issue is still not resolved.
