Most artists🖌️ create their masterpieces🖼️ when they feel bored😑 or feel alone. But now, we instantly use our smartphones📱 and check social media when we feel bored. That's what cuts our creativity🎨. So my advice is that, when you feel bored, instead of checking your phone, take a pen🖊️ and paper📃, write whatever comes to your mind🧠. Sometimes those things that came to your mind can change your life✨.
