##### Quote of the Week 💬
>ONE SURE WAY TO SAVE MONEY Stop Trying to Impress Other People It’s an endless and fruitless waste of time and money, plus others are likely so busy trying to impress you that they will, at best, not notice your efforts. At worst, they will resent you for one-upping them.
