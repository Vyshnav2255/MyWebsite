Hi👋

This week I was working on the web version of my [Notion Icons 2.0](/blog/notion-icons-2-0) pack. It is one of the most popular free icon pack for Notion. And probably I will be releasing it next week. Currently it is undergoing testing and doing pretty well. Thanks to all people who have shown their interest for testing it.

Next week I'm so excited for the release of [Elementary OS 6 Odin](https://twitter.com/vyshnav_xyz/status/1423459496005758976?s=19). I have been an elementary OS user for more than a year, and [I'm really loving it](/blog/elementary-os-review-8-months-later). If you are someone who is looking forward to using linux operating system, I highly recommend giving it a try.
