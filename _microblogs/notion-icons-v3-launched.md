Notion Icons 3.0 is now available as a website. Now you can easily use these icons on your Notion workspace. The pack contains 224 icons. All icons are available in 8 different colors.

I highly recommend you to check out the "[Get Started](https://notionv3.vyshnav.xyz/get-started)" page for using these icons easily. This page also gives an overview of how the website works.
