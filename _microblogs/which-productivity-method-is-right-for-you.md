If you're thinking of becoming productive this year✨ and don't know the different productivity methods, I highly recommend you check out this website🌐 made by the makers of [Todoist](https://doist.grsm.io/vyshnavgangadharan6232) and Twist. You need to take a quiz✅, and it will recommend the most appropriate method for you. Please be honest while taking the quiz to get a more relevant answer. You can even read about other methods from the website🌐.
