Oxygen OS was one of my favourite versions of Android. I loved the clean look and cool features provided by it. I'm still using it on my daily driver OnePlus 5T. The only reason why I bought this device was its software. But now the software is dead.

OnePlus has really changed over the last two years. They used to be a fan-based company, but now they have lost many fans with their recent merging with OPPO. Oxygen OS was the reason why most people chose OnePlus devices.

You can watch this video made by Beebom about the recent Oxygen OS update.
