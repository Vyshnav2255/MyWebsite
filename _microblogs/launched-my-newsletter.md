Starting a newsletter is one of the items on my impossible list. And today, I'm so happy to announce that I have launched my newsletter. I have named it Sunday Summary ü•ù.

Sunday Summary is a weekly newsletter where I write about things I created, enjoyed, and discovered that week. Also, you will receive productivity tips, early access to Notion templates, articles, book notes, and other interesting things before it goes public.
