## Smartphone Setup
---
![img](/Images/Microblog/My Smartphone Setup May 2021.png)

### Setup

The launcher which I'm using is the Niagara Launcher. It is a minimalistic launcher and very easy to use. It has a lot of unique features. I highly recommend you to check out this launcher.

The wallpaper is from [Todoist](/resources/referrals/#todoist). It is their Year in Review wallpaper.

### Apps

**Notion**

I have talked about it several times in my previous blog posts and What's on My Phone articles. It is a mixture of many productivity apps. It is like my second brain. All the contents which I make and consume go here. But I use SimpleNotes for quick note-taking. I have made [two icon packs and one template for Notion](/blog/tags#notion); check them out if you are interested.

**Google Drive**

It is my favorite cloud storage app of choice, mainly because of the free 15GB storage. I don't store any large data's on the cloud, so for me, this is enough, And the only drawback is that it doesn't have a Linux client. So I also use [Dropbox](/resources/referrals/#dropbox) along with this, which has an excellent Linux client. I'm going to change to Nextcloud in the future.

**Todoist**

It is the best to-do app. It has one of the best UI and has a lot of awesome features. The main reason why I use it is that it is available on every platform. It also has a lot of integration with other apps, making automation more effortless, and it also has Google Calendar integration. I use it in combination with [Tap-Tap](https://github.com/KieronQuinn/TapTap). This helps me add tasks to [Todoist](/resources/referrals/#todoist) just by double-tapping the back of my phone. I will write a detailed article on this soon.

**Google Calendar**

I use it for planning my day, and It is integrated with my Todoist account, so the tasks appear as calendar events. It also helps me plan and view upcoming events. I also use [Woven](https://woven.com/ref/vyshnav0039) along with this, which is my favorite calendar service. But currently, they don't have an android app, so I'm using Google Calendar.

**SimpleNotes**

I recently found this app while looking for an alternative for Google Keep. As Keep doesn't have a desktop client and is not suitable for writing lengthy articles, I found this. [SimpleNotes](https://simplenote.com/) is an open-source minimal note-taking app and is available on all major platforms. And this article is written on SimpleNotes. It helps me to write articles on both smartphone and desktop. And also, it syncs fast.

**Google Fit**

This year I am more focused on health, so to track my workouts, sleep, etc. I use Google Fit. It syncs data from my other fitness apps to get all the data in one place. Recently they have added lots of new features and improved the UI.

**Forest**

I use Forest while doing some intensive tasks. It has helped me a lot to keep my phone away from me. And the feature which I like the most is growing real trees. The premium version allows you to select the app you want to use when the timer is turned on.

**Pocket Casts**

It is my podcast app of choice. It lets you highly customize how you listen to a podcast. It has a great UI and is one of the best podcast app available.
