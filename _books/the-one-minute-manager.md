- People who feel good about themselves produce good results.

- A problem only exists if there is a difference between what is actually happening and what you desire to be happening.

- One minute goals work well when you
    
    - Plan the goals together and describe them briefly and clearly. Show people what good performance looks like.
    
    - Have people write out each of their goals, with due dates, on a single page.
    
    - Ask them to review their most important goals each day, which takes only a few minutes to do.
    
    - Encourage people to take a minute to look at what they’re doing, and see if their behavior matches their goals.
    
    - If it doesn’t, encourage them to re-think what they’re doing so they can realize their goals sooner.

- Help people reach their full potential. Catch them doing something right.

- One Minute Praising works well when you

    - Praise people as soon as possible.

    - Let people know what they did right—be specific.

    - Tell people how good you feel about what they did right, and how it helps.

    - Pause for a moment to allow people time to feel good about what they’ve done.

    - Encourage them to do more of the same.

    - Make it clear you have confidence in them and support their success.

- Praising people doesn’t always work if it isn’t combined with Re-Directs to correct mistakes when they occur.

- A one minute re-direct works well when you

    - Re-Direct people as soon as possible.

    - Confirm the facts first, and review the mistake together—be specific.

    - Express how you feel about the mistake and its impact on results.

    - Be quiet for a moment to allow people time to feel concerned about what they’ve done.

    - Remember to let them know that they’re better than their mistake, and that you think well of them as a person.

    - Remind them that you have confidence and trust in them, and support their success.

    - Realize that when the Re-Direct is over, it’s over.

- The best minute I spend is the one I invest in people.

- It’s ironic that most companies spend so much of their money on people’s salaries, and yet they spend only a small fraction of their budget to develop people.

- The number one motivator of people is feedback on results. They want to know how they’re doing.

- Feedback Is the Breakfast of Champions. It’s feedback that keeps us going.

- Everyone is a potential winner. Some people are disguised as losers. Don’t let their appearances fool you.

- Take a minute to look at your goals. Then look at what you’re doing and see if it matches your goals.

- Rather than punish inexperienced people who are still learning, we need to re-direct them.

- It’s not fair to people to save up negative feelings about their poor performance, and it’s not effective.

- If you are first tough on the behavior, and then supportive of the person, it works better.

- Tell people what they did wrong; tell them how you feel about it; and remind them they are better than that.

- We are not just our behavior. We are the person managing our behavior.

- Making mistakes is not the problem. It’s not learning from them that causes real problems.

- Goals begin behaviors. Consequences influence future behaviors.
