> “If you can change your mind, you can change your life.”― William James

- We’re creatures of habit who prefer relaxing our mind instead of straining it.

- “The life of wisdom is a life of reason. It is important to learn how to think clearly. Clear thinking is not a haphazard enterprise. It
requires proper training.”

- Thoughts should serve a useful purpose. If they don’t, they’re useless. That’s straight thinking.

- The better you are at something, the more value you can provide to
others, and the more money people are willing to pay in exchange for
your value.

- Understanding that life is not linear helps us to change the way we think.

- Steve Jobs said, “You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can
only connect them looking backward. So you have to trust that the dots
will somehow connect in your future.”

- If you want the dots to connect in the future, you have to make sure
you form dots in your brain. The only way you form dots is by learning,
doing, making mistakes, reflecting, or anything you can do to feed your
brain with the input it needs to give you the output you want.

- If you want to have useful thoughts, here’s a rule of thumb: Only think
about things you can control. That automatically eliminates about 99% of your thoughts because there’s very little you control in life.

- Commit to stop thinking about useless things. Start taking control of
your mind. All that worrying about the past and the future is not going
to help you. It never did. And it never will.

- When I reach a wall, I know I’m close to the next stage of my
development. Instead of giving up, I’m happy. All I need to do, is to
take a break, rejuvenate, and let my mind recover.

> “Conquer yourself rather than the world.”― René Descartes
 
- Money is a replaceable resource. When you’re out of it, you can earn it
back. You can’t say the same for time. Don’t spend too much time
thinking about money.

- You’ll find that the moments you’re not thinking are just as important as the times you are actively thinking.

- It’s not this or that in life. You can have this and that.

- When you stop doing things the way they’re done, you’ll start doing things how you get it done.

- There’s no point in asking “why”when you deal with obstacles,
challenges, or mistakes. Instead, think about what you can do to
overcome or prevent the things that are holding you back.

- When you combine a few rules, you have a system. And a system helps you to take the thinking part out of the equation. The only thinking you
need to do is when your system doesn’t give you the results you want.

- You don’t regret what you did in life, you regret what you didn’t do.

- Just sit down, be one with your thoughts, observe them, and then, ignore them. That’s all there is to meditation.

- “The greatest use of a life is to spend it on something that will outlast it.”
