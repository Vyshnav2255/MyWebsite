- When a man really desires a thing so deeply that he is willing to stake his entire future on a single turn of the wheel in order to get it, he is sure to win.
- “When one is truly ready for a thing, it puts in its appearance.”
- When the opportunity came, it appeared in a different form, and from a different direction than Barnes had expected. That is one of the tricks of opportunity. It has a sly habit of slipping in by the back door, and often it comes disguised in the form of misfortune, or temporary defeat. Perhaps this is why so many fail to recognize opportunity.
- One of the most common causes of failure is the habit of quitting when one is overtaken by temporary defeat. Every person is guilty of this mistake at one time or another.
- Before success comes in any man’s life, he is sure to meet with much temporary defeat, and, perhaps, some failure. When defeat overtakes a man, the easiest and most logical thing to do is to quit. That is exactly what the majority of men do.
- More than five hundred of the most successful men this country has ever known, told the author their greatest success came just one step beyond the point at which defeat had overtaken them. Failure is a trickster with a keen sense of irony and cunning
- When riches begin to come they come so quickly, in such great abundance, that one wonders where they have been hiding during all those lean years.
- When you begin to think and grow rich, you will observe that riches begin with a state of mind, with definiteness of purpose, with little or no hard work.
- Success comes to those who become success conscious.
- We are the Masters of our Fate, the Captains of our Souls, because we have the power to control our thoughts.
- He should have told us, that before we can accumulate riches in great abundance, we must magnetize our minds with intense desire for riches, that we must become “money conscious until the desire for money drives us to create definite plans for acquiring it.
- Every human being who reaches the age of understanding of the purpose of money, wishes for it. Wishing will not bring riches. But desiring riches with a state of mind that becomes an obsession, then planning definite ways and means to acquire riches, and backing those plans with persistence which does not recognize failure, will bring riches.
- The turning point in the lives of those who succeed, usually comes at the moment of some crisis, through which they are introduced to their “other selves.”
- Most people never learn the art of transmuting their strongest emotions into dreams of a constructive nature.
- Kindle anew in your mind the fire of hope, faith, courage, and tolerance. If you have these states of mind, and a working knowledge of the principles described, all else that you need will come to you, when you are ready for it.
- “Our only limitations are those we set up in our own minds.”
- A mind dominated by positive emotions, becomes a favorable abode for the state of mind known as faith. A mind so dominated may, at will, give the subconscious mind instructions, which it will accept and act upon immediately.
- Faith is the basis of all “miracles,” and all mysteries which cannot be analyzed by the rules of science!
- Faith is the only known antidote for failure!
- If a man repeats a lie over and over, he will eventually accept the lie as truth.
- If there are any such phenomena as “miracles” they are produced only through the state of mind known as faith!
- There are no limitations to the mind except those we acknowledge.
- An educated man is one who has so developed the faculties of his mind that he may acquire anything he wants, or its equivalent, without violating the rights of others.
- As knowledge is acquired it must be organized and put into use, for a definite purpose, through practical plans. Knowledge has no value except that which can be gained from its application toward some worthy end. This is one reason why college degrees are not valued more highly. They represent nothing but miscellaneous knowledge.
- It has been said that man can create anything which he can imagine.
- Ideas can be transmuted into cash through the power of definite purpose, plus definite plans.
- The man who cannot control himself, can never control others.
- Without a sense of fairness and justice, no leader can command and retain the respect of his followers.
- The man who wavers in his decisions, shows that he is not sure of himself. He cannot lead others successfully.
